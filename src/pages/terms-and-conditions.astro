      <h2>3. Virtual Credits in "Worlds"</h2>
      <p>
        "Worlds" offers virtual credits ("Credits") for purchase, which can be used 
        within the application. By purchasing Credits, you acknowledge and agree that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Credits are non-refundable, except in cases of technical issues.</li>
        <li>Credits have no real-world monetary value and cannot be exchanged for cash.</li>
        <li>Unauthorized reselling, transferring, or trading of Credits is strictly prohibited.</li>
        <li>We reserve the right to modify the availability, pricing, or use of Credits at any time.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Refund and Dispute Policy</h2>
      <p>
        All sales of virtual Credits are final. Refunds are issued only in cases 
        where technical issues prevent the proper delivery of Credits. If you encounter
