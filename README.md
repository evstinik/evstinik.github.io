# Hi! I'm Nikita.

I'm a Software Engineer based in Prague, Czech Republic 🇨🇿.

- I develop [complex and high-performance user interfaces](https://www.saboit.de/references/audi-dpa) ⚡ using modern tools like React ⚛️ and WebGL.
- I enjoy solving problems with software and take a practical approach to my work. My pet projects include a Teams lunch bot, a Telegram news bot, a personal finance app, and a streaming app.
- In the past, I worked with the iOS platform using Swift and Objective-C and [explored](https://www.saboit.de/blog/lidar-data-in-arkit-3-5) the early versions of ARKit.
- I enjoy working with 3D graphics and VR, making [small games](https://hacknick.itch.io/christmas-mini-game) and occasionally participating in [game jams](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/53/delirium-and-deliverance).
- I like electronic music, have created a few tracks, and am also learning to play the piano 🎹.
